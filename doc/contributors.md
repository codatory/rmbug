Special mention: 

rmBug started off a GitlabHQ fork, in attempt to establish a community-lead
project with FOSS best practices, as well as to innovate in the software
project management space.

GitlabHQ was created by Dmitriy Zaporozhets, and we want to thank him for
his and contributions of many other people who contributed to GitlabHQ.
