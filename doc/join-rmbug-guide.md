# Join rmBug project

We'd like anyone to be able to contribute to rmBug. Where that contribution consists of code, graphics, documentation or some other form (particularly that which would be covered by copyright), we do ask that people formally state their agreement to the project contributor agreement. It isn't a formal contract, but does assure us that you're able to contribute, and is roughly a code of conduct for this project.

Your application will be accepted when you complete the agreement below by making a commit whose sole content is consisted of
adding your name and email to the contributors file.

* All contributions to the project must be the original work of the contributor, or contributed on the behalf of an organisation who has previously undertaken this agreement. In particular, make sure your contributions cannot be claimed by your employer / University / other organisation!

* Contributions must be licensed under the terms of the MIT as published by the Open Source Initiative.

* Commits to git must be reviewed via pull requests (or otherwise) by a member of the Core Development squad.

* Contributors should co-ordinate via various communication mediums offered to rmBug community.

* Contributors are ambassadors of the project. Behave accordingly; Bongo is the world's most friendly project (in my estimation :).

* From time to time, the project will publish coding standards, documentation standards, and other contribution guidelines. Contributors should endeavour to follow them.

* You may revoke your agreement to this at any time; however, your contributions to that point cannot be revoked.
Where this agreement is broken, or contributions were found to not be the original work of the contributor, the contributor may be removed from the project and/or have their previous contributions removed.

# Contribution workflow

If you would like to contribute, there are two ways you can go about it:

* make your own fork, and submit a pull request

* create a branch in rmbug repo, and submit a pull request

While we might make exceptions for contributors who do not have commit privileges to the
rmBug repository yet, contributors who do are encouraged to create topic branches with
the following naming:

- feature/topic
- bugfix/topic
- refactor/topic
- redesign/topic

After that, a member of the development team will review your pull request, and comment if
needed.

Please be aware that in order to avoid wasting time, we strongly suggest you to discuss your
ideas with the community and development team before starting on it.
